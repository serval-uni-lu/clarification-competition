"""SoftSecAdaptive: adaptive clarification, then requirement-based review and test-based repair.

1. Adaptive clarification: uses accumulated answer statistics to choose numbered or focused
   questions, then iteratively revises an initial implementation using actual user answers.
2. Requirement consolidation: builds an audited, source-linked requirement inventory from the original
   statement and recorded answers. Explicit user corrections take precedence over conflicting
   statement content within their scope.
3. Implementation review: identifies concrete requirement violations and attempts bounded,
   independently reviewed changes while preserving the clarification checkpoint.
4. Test generation and execution: generates Python test inputs and two separate reference
   implementations, then executes them through env.exec_code. Reference agreement supplies expected
   outputs, with explicit source examples taking priority.
5. Checkpoint comparison: when test findings justify reconsideration, compares the current
   implementation with the clarification checkpoint on the same test set and selects a candidate
   using reviewed, weighted evidence.
6. Targeted repair: attempts a focused repair for remaining confirmed defects. Adoption considers
   weighted improvements, regressions, and requirement-preservation checks; otherwise, the selected
   implementation is retained.

Main pipeline per task: draft (plan, then code under the most conventional reading) -> restate in
plain words what the code does -> ask what must change -> read the reply (one-word label; stop if
it only confirms) -> revise against all replies -> repeat until confirmed, unchanged, max_questions
or env.can_ask() is false -> stages 2-6 -> finalize (definitions only, `from __future__ import
annotations`, lower-case alias of the entry point, and a call wrapper that runs the direct call
first and only retries with adjusted arguments if it raises). If a refinement stage fails, the
clarified code is returned.

The only configurable parameter is max_questions (default 10); all other settings are fixed.

Keep the original text and ALL actual question/answer pairs available. Concrete
behavioral facts in actual replies correct only their affected scope. A later explicit
correction replaces the earlier fact in that scope; do not require superseded facts
to remain simultaneously true. Questions alone are NOT
new facts. Resolve an unqualified approval against the exact proposal it approves;
partial approval or yes-but confirms only the expressly approved scope, and applies
all new facts/corrections/additions. Separate factual corrections from feasibility
judgments: "impossible", "cannot implement", or "raise NotImplementedError because
requirements conflict" is not itself required program behavior. Keep usable facts
in a mixed reply, mark the feasibility judgment as uncertain context, and choose
an implementable interpretation instead of turning normal inputs into refusal.
Explicit task-defined error cases or no-solution outputs ARE behavior and survive.
A refusal/non-answer adds no requirements.
Keep unrelated semantics, argument order/types, output type, boundaries and examples.
Rewrite affected content naturally, add new conditions without requiring a matching old
substring, remove superseded conflicts. Do not invent defaults or enforce input-domain
assumptions as runtime validation. Do not demand an algorithm or extra checks.
Return a JSON object with three keys: statement (a string containing the ACTUAL complete
current task, never a schema description), units (a nonempty list), answer_coverage (a list).
Each unit has id (unique string), text (an actual complete requirement), kind (one of
behavior, interface, input_assumption, example, context), source_ids (a list of supplied IDs).
Each answer_coverage row has turn (integer), interpretation (confirmation, correction,
addition, mixed or non_answer), scope (actual meaning affected), unit_ids (existing IDs).
Do not return placeholder labels such as "complete current text" or "one complete requirement".
The full statement and all units must express the same actual task, including every boundary,
return type, ordering and interface constraint. Resolve only explicit scoped corrections.
Cover every actual reply once, including confirmations. Every non-non_answer must cite
its corresponding QA:n in at least one unit. Do not discard additions because a reply
also confirms. Units describe meaning, not character spans. Return no candidate code."""

faithful usable interpretation instead of rejecting every small uncertainty. Mark
accepted false for a concrete material change of meaning or lost actual correction,
not punctuation, minor redundancy or speculative concerns. A false minor_scope or
coherent_result check need not veto an otherwise faithful statement; explain why. Example active=false if a real correction supersedes it, in_domain=false
if it is outside the currently allowed domain. For active=false or in_domain=false,
include superseding_turn: the actual answer number supplying the explicit change (0 only
for an explicit domain constraint already in the original), and superseding_quote: an exact
nonempty excerpt of that actual source supporting the decision. A proposal or generic Yes
alone cannot discard an example. Do not mark a contradictory example as consistent; compare
its literal input/output with the proposed units. Never change a rejection to satisfy format."""

Separate concrete behavioral corrections from judgments that implementation is
impossible. A feasibility judgment does not authorize unconditional refusal;
produce the required no-solution return value rather than adding input rejection or an intentional exception.
Any interpretation ledger describes a candidate hypothesis, not new user facts.
EXAMPLE_AUTHORITY_CHECKS is a scoped audit, not an additional human answer.

ACTIVE_SOURCE_EXAMPLE_IDS lists the approved literal examples for checking;
other examples remain audit context, not proof that their old outputs are right.
A partial correction is not blanket approval. Actual human corrections override
only affected old requirements; unchanged constraints survive. Local ambiguity
must not veto unrelated well-supported behavior: mark only that input/domain
unclear and continue with the best-supported interpretation elsewhere.
Never infer semantics from names, benchmark

The x/0 above ONLY illustrate JSON shape. Use the actual argument names and real
bounds from SOURCE_LINES. Do not copy example values or invent a domain.
Do not assign target IDs or cross-reference a coverage table: the program does it.
Within MAX_TARGETS, cover both sides of task-stated branch thresholds and their valid neighbors.
Include a bounded larger-size or larger-magnitude input target when the actual domain permits;
do not restrict all testing to tiny values. Derive these targets only from actual sources,
never from candidate code, solution branches or benchmark memory.
Give at most MAX_TARGETS useful targets. family is normal,zero,empty,boundary,
neighbor,type,duplicates,order,random. Include only grounded applicable targets;
omitted families remain unknown, not implicitly covered. Never require excluded
zero/empty inputs. A boundary and its neighbors must be inside the actual domain.
Evidence selects real SOURCE_LINES, using source CURRENT_REQUIREMENTS or
AUTHORITY_CONTEXT and optional inclusive line_start/line_end. A source-only
selection is allowed when the rule spans that document. No copied quotations.
Predicate path is ["arguments","actual_parameter_name", optional indexes...].
Allowed predicates: eq/lt/le/gt/ge and length_eq/length_lt/length_le/length_gt/
length_ge use value as a normal JSON value (number, string, bool, null, list).
For Python-specific tuples/sets/bytes, use value_literal as a quoted Python literal.
Do not emit Python expressions such as len(x)-1. Use a supported concrete target
or omit that target. type uses type_name: NoneType,bool,int,float,str,bytes,list,
tuple,set,dict. empty/nonempty/duplicates/unique take only op and path.
Composite predicates: {"op":"all" or "any","items":[predicates]} or

Expected values are either exact, scope-audited examples quoted from the actual
source, or results obtained by EXECUTING two candidate-blind reference programs.
The case metadata identifies which. Actual examples are stronger evidence; model
reference agreement is fallible evidence, not a command to mimic an oracle. Read domain, types,
argument order, return contract and the actual observed value. Do not authorize
an algorithm preference, defensive validation not required by the task, or an
unexplained oracle discrepancy. Distinguish concrete ambiguity from minor wording concerns.
A small unrelated uncertainty does not veto a well-grounded behavioral correction.
