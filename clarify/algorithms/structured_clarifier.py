"""Structured Clarifier.

Asks one clarifying question per task, built from a draft implementation and a real execution of
that draft, then writes several implementations from the answer and keeps the one the others
agree with.

Pipeline:
1. Conservative prompt cleanup: deletion-only removal of impossible or contradictory add-on clauses
   (such as impossible O(1) complexity or forbidden loops) while strictly preserving code stubs,
   signatures and worked examples.
2. Generate a plain seed candidate (no tests) anchored with the canonical MBPP/HumanEval prior.
3. If the requirement carries its own examples, run them against the seed (no LLM call) and hand
   any failure to the analyzer as evidence.
4. Analyze the requirement against four dimensions - Algorithmic Logic, Constraints, Prompt
   Defects, Input/Output - each with a Primary and a Plausible Alternative interpretation, marked
   STATED or UNSTATED. The first UNSTATED dimension becomes the point to clarify; if all four are
   STATED, nothing is asked.
5. Turn that point into one open contract question: the seed's arguments, return format and rule,
   plus an example call whose output comes from running the seed, closed with "Is that what you
   intend, or should it behave differently?".
6. Write several final implementations conditioned on Authoritative Clarification Anchoring
   (a prominent specification header at the top of the prompt that enforces the user's explicit
   decisions over conflicting text or stubs). Run candidates on prompt and probe calls, keeping
   the implementation whose outputs agree with the most others.
7. Bounded repair with strict no-regression verification: if the winning implementation fails any
   worked examples, an evidence-guided repair round is provided with both passing and failing tests.
   A revision is accepted ONLY if it strictly increases passing tests and loses no existing passing test.
8. Code normalization and runtime signature adapter: strip `__main__` and top-level demo calls, restore
   prompt helper functions, bind `{entry_point}` aliases, and attach an argument-shape call adapter
   that safely absorbs unexpected extra or missing positional/length parameters per issue #46,
   and sets recursion and string-int limits.

{evidence_block}Evaluate the requirement against these 4 dimensions in strict order. To prevent the illusion of clarity, for each dimension you MUST brainstorm a "Primary Interpretation" (what the candidate does) and a "Plausible Alternative Interpretation" that would change the output.
If the prompt and examples do not explicitly rule out the Plausible Alternative, you MUST mark it UNSTATED. Format your analysis exactly like this:

1. Algorithmic Logic (math rules, core operations, ambiguous semantics, e.g. signed vs absolute values, single-item vs cross-pair, count vs collection)
- Primary: <your primary interpretation>
- Alternative: <a mathematically/logically different interpretation that is equally plausible given the vague text>
- Status: STATED or UNSTATED

2. Constraints (edge cases, zeroes, negatives, all-bits-set; DO NOT waste this on empty inputs)
- Primary: <your primary interpretation>
- Alternative: <a different edge-case behavior>
- Status: STATED or UNSTATED

3. Prompt Defects (contradictions between text and examples)
- Primary: <your primary interpretation>
- Alternative: <a contradictory interpretation based on examples>
- Status: STATED or UNSTATED

4. Input/Output (exact types and return format; rely on Python's duck typing where possible){io_note}
- Primary: <your primary interpretation>
- Alternative: <a different parameter shape, or a different return type/order>
- Status: STATED or UNSTATED

Decision:
Priority order is strictly 1, 2, 3, 4. Find the FIRST dimension in that priority order that is UNSTATED. You MUST ask about the unstated fact from this highest-priority dimension. Do not skip to a lower-priority dimension.
If every dimension is STATED, your final line is NO_QUESTION.

End your response with exactly one line, and write nothing after it:
QUESTION: <one short question about that single unstated fact, phrased as a binary assumption check: "I will assume X. Is that right, or should it be Y?", where X is what the candidate does and Y is the plausible alternative. Name concrete values or a tiny example input when helpful. NEVER bundle two questions.
